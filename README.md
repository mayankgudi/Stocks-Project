Stocks Project - Python

This project utilizes information from the New York Stock Exchange to sort and display information based on the user's selection. The project's main purpose is to test my organization skills. 
Utlizing various data structures I must find a way to properly gather and display to correct information for the user. The project consists of two primary CSV files, prices.csv and sec.csv, as 
well as two secondary files, p.csv and s.csv, which are shortened versions of the primary files. Do take a look at the various files in the code.
